# Python

**GaussianSim.ipynb** is the Python version of the Listeria monocytogenes cell-cell spread simulation described in the **Listeria_spread_simulations** repository, reproduced here: "simulation of Listeria spread where the size of the hop is sampled from a Normal distribution with mean = 0 and std = sqrt(2Dt)." Update on 4/13/18: generation of Normal random numbers was Cythonized. Running the simulation up to 1e6 bacteria was speeded up from ~7 seconds to ~1.7 seconds. The code also measures the area of the convex hull of the bacterial focus. Update 4/15/18: you can run the simulation more than once by setting N to an integer. The simulation will be run N times and the circularity of the bacterial focus will be averaged. The array bactposData will store the bacterial positions for each of the runs.
